  abstract = {Supertree methods are used to assemble separate phylogenetic trees
	with shared taxa into larger trees (supertrees) in an effort to construct
	more comprehensive phylogenetic hypotheses. In spite of much recent
	interest in supertrees, there are still few methods for supertree
	construction. The flip supertree problem is an error correction approach
	that seeks to find a minimum number of changes (flips) to the matrix
	representation of the set of input trees to resolve their incompatibilities.
	A previous flip supertree algorithm was limited to finding exact
	solutions and was only feasible for small input trees. We developed
	a heuristic algorithm for the flip supertree problem suitable for
	much larger input trees. We used a series of 48- and 96-taxon simulations
	to compare supertrees constructed with the flip supertree heuristic
	algorithm with supertrees constructed using other approaches, including
	MinCut (MC), modified MC (MMC), and matrix representation with parsimony
	(MRP). Flip supertrees are generally far more accurate than supertrees
	constructed using MC or MMC algorithms and are at least as accurate
	as supertrees built with MRP. The flip supertree method is therefore
	a viable alternative to other supertree methods when the number of
	taxa is large.},

  abstract = {Although the reconstruction of phylogenetic trees and the computation
	of multiple sequence alignments are highly interdependent, these
	two areas of research lead quite separate lives, the former often
	making use of stochastic modeling, whereas the latter normally does
	not. Despite the fact that reasonable insertion and deletion models
	for sequence pairs were already introduced more than 10 years ago,
	they have only recently been applied to multiple alignment and only
	in their simplest version. In this paper we present and discuss a
	strategy based on simulated annealing, which makes use of these models
	to infer a phylogenetic tree for a set of DNA or protein sequences
	together with the sequences'indel history, i.e., their multiple alignment
	augmented with information about the positioning of insertion and
	deletion events in the tree. Our method is also the first application
	of the TKF2 model in the context of multiple sequence alignment.
	We validate the method via simulations and illustrate it using a
	data set of primate mtDNA.}

	the observed gaps and find the most parsimonious assignment of nucleotides.
	The gaps of the alignment are represented in a so-called gap graph,
	and through theoretically sound preprocessing the graph is reduced
	to pave the way for a running time which in all but the most pathological
	examples is far better than the exponential worst case time. E.g.
	for a tree with nine leaves and a random alignment of length 10.000
	with 60% gaps, the running time is on average around 45 seconds.
	For a real alignment of length 9868 of nine HIV-1 sequences, the

  pages = {485-495},

  abstract = {Roshan et al. recently described a divide-and-conquertechnique for
	parsimony analysis of large data sets, Rec-I-DCM3, and stated that
	it compares very favorably to results using the program TNT. Their
	technique is based on selecting subsets of taxa to create reduced
	data sets or subproblems, finding most-parsimonious trees for each
	reduced data set, recombining all parts together, and then performing
	global TBR swapping on the combined tree. Here, we contrast this
	approach to sectorial searches, a divide-and-conquer algorithm implemented
	in TNT. This algorithm also uses a guide tree to create subproblems,
	with the first-pass state sets of the nodes that join the selected
	sectors with the rest of the topology; this allows exact length calculations
	for the entire topology (that is, any solution N steps shorter than
	the original, for the reduced subproblem, must also be N steps shorter
	for the entire topology). We show here that, for sectors of similar
	size analyzed with the same search algorithms, subdividing data sets
	with sectorial searches produces better results than subdividing
	with Rec-I-DCM3. Roshan et al.'s claim that Rec-I-DCM3 outperforms
	the techniques in TNT was caused by a poor experimental design and
	algorithmic settings used for the runs in TNT. In particular, for
	finding trees at or very close to the minimum known length of the
	analyzed data sets, TNT clearly outperforms Rec-I-DCM3. Finally,
	we show that the performance of Rec-I-DCM3 is bound by the efficiency
	of TBR implementation for the complete data set, as this method behaves
	(after some number of iterations) as a technique for cyclic perturbations
	and improvements more than as a divide-and-conquer strategy.},

  pages = {696-704},

  abstract = {The increase in the number of large data sets and the complexity of
	current probabilistic sequence evolution models necessitates fast
	and reliable phylogeny reconstruction methods. We describe a new
	approach, based on the maximum- likelihood principle, which clearly
	satisfies these requirements. The core of this method is a simple
	hill-climbing algorithm that adjusts tree topology and branch lengths
	simultaneously. This algorithm starts from an initial tree built
	by a fast distance-based method and modifies this tree to improve
	its likelihood at each iteration. Due to this simultaneous adjustment
	of the topology and branch lengths, only a few iterations are sufficient
	to reach an optimum. We used extensive and realistic computer simulations
	to show that the topological accuracy of this new method is at least
	as high as that of the existing maximum-likelihood programs and much
	higher than the performance of distance-based and parsimony approaches.
	The reduction of computing time is dramatic in comparison with other
	maximum-likelihood packages, while the likelihood maximization ability
	tends to be higher. For example, only 12 min were required on a standard
	personal computer to analyze a data set consisting of 500 rbcL sequences
	with 1,428 base pairs from plant plastids, thus reaching a speed
	of the same order as some popular distance-based and parsimony algorithms.
	This new method is implemented in the PHYML program, which is freely
	available on our web page: http://www.lirmm.fr/w3ifa/MAAS/.},

  abstract = {Algorithms are presented that allow the calculation of the probability
	of a set of sequences related by a binary tree that have evolved
	according to the Thorne-Kishino-Felsenstein model for a fixed set
	of parameters. The algorithms are based on a Markov chain generating
	sequences and their alignment at nodes in a tree. Depending on whether
	the complete realization of this Markov chain is decomposed into
	the first transition and the rest of the realization or the last
	transition and the first part of the realization, two kinds of recursions
	are obtained that are computationally similar but probabilistically
	different. The running time of the algorithms is O(Pi id=1 Li), where
	Li is the length of the ith observed sequences and d is the number
	of sequences. An alternative recursion is also formulated that uses
	only a Markov chain involving the inner nodes of a tree.}

	trees, for a total of 5,000 replications per condition. Accuracy
	was measured by two measures of the distance between the true tree
	and the estimate of the tree, one measure sensitive to accuracy of
	branch lengths and the other not. The distance-matrix methods (Fitch-Margoliash
	and neighbor joining) performed best when they were constrained from
	estimating negative branch lengths; all comparisons with other methods
	used this constraint. Parsimony and compatibility had similar results,
	with compatibility generally inferior; Fitch-Margoliash and neighbor
	joining had similar results, with neighbor joining generally slightly
	inferior. Maximum likelihood was the most successful method overall,
	although for short sequences Fitch-Margoliash and neighbor joining
	were sometimes better. Bias of the estimates was inferred by measuring
	whether the independent estimates of a tree for different data sets
	were closer to the true tree than to each other. Parsimony and compatibility
	had particular difficulty with inaccuracy and bias when substitution
	rates varied among different branches. When rates of evolution varied
	among different sites, all methods showed signs of inaccuracy and
	bias.},

  journal = {Systematic Biology},
  year = {2011},
  abstract = {We explored the efficacy of species tree methods at the family level
	in birds, using the Australo-Papuan Fairy-wrens (Passeriformes: Maluridae)
	as a model system. Fairy-wrens of the genus Malurus are known for
	high intensities of sexual selection, resulting in some cases in
	rapid speciation. This history suggests that incomplete lineage sorting
	(ILS) of neutrally evolving loci could be substantial, a situation
	that could compromise traditional methods of combining loci in phylogenetic
	analysis. Using eighteen molecular markers (5 anonymous loci, 7 exons,
	5 introns and one mtDNA locus), we show that gene tree monophyly
	across species could be rejected for 16 out of 18 loci, suggesting
	substantial ILS at the family level in these birds. Using the software
	Concaterpillar, we also detect three statistically distinct clusters
	of gene trees among the 18 loci. Despite substantial variation in
	gene trees, species trees constructed using four different species
	tree estimation methods (BEST, BUCKy, and STAR) were generally well-supported
	and similar to each other and to the concatenation tree, with a few
	mild discordances at nodes that could explained by rapid and recent
	speciation events. By contrast, minimizing deep coalescences (MDC)
	produced a species tree that was topologically more divergent from
	those of the other methods as measured by multidimensional scaling
	of trees. Additionally, gene and species trees were topologically
	more similar in the BEST analysis, presumably because of the species
	tree prior employed in BEST which appropriately assumes that gene
	trees are correlated with each other and with the species tree. Among
	the 18 loci we also discovered 102 independent indel markers, which
	also proved phylogenetically informative, primarily among genera,
	and displayed a ~4-fold bias towards deletions. As suggested in earlier
	work, the grasswrens (Amytornis) are sister to the rest of the family,
	and the emu-wrens (Stipiturus) are sister to fairy-wrens (Malurus,
	Clytomias). Our study shows that ILS is common at the family level
	in birds yet, despite this, species tree methods converge on broadly
	similar results for this family. },

	based on the TKF91 model of Thorne, Kishino, and Felsenstein (1991)
	on an arbitrary k-leaved phylogenetic tree. The existing algorithms
	use a hidden Markov model approach, which requires at least O( radical
	5(k)) states and leads to a time complexity of O(5(k)L(k)), where
	L is the geometric mean sequence length. Using a combinatorial technique
	reminiscent of inclusion/exclusion, we are able to sum away the states,
	thus improving the time complexity to O(2(k)L(k)) and considerably
	reducing memory requirements. This makes statistical multiple alignment
	under the TKF91 model a definite practical possibility in the case
	of a phylogenetic tree with a modest number of leaves.}

	when events such as hybrid speciation and horizontal gene transfer
	occur. In spite of their widely acknowledged importance in evolutionary
	biology, phylogenetic networks have so far been studied mostly for
	specific data sets. We present a general definition of phylogenetic
	networks in terms of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and a set of
	conditions. Further, we distinguish between model networks and reconstructible
	ones and characterize the effect of extinction and taxon sampling
	on the reconstructibility of the network. Simulation studies are
	a standard technique for assessing the performance of phylogenetic
	methods. A main step in such studies entails quantifying the topological
	error between the model and inferred phylogenies. While many measures
	of tree topological accuracy have been proposed, none exist for phylogenetic
	networks. Previously, we proposed the first such measure, which applied
	only to a restricted class of networks. In this paper, we extend
	that measure to apply to all networks, and prove that it is a metric
	on the space of phylogenetic networks. Our results allow for the
	systematic study of existing network methods, and for the design
	of new accurate ones.},

	trees from DNA sequences. The program can be run on a wide variety
	of computers ranging from Unix workstations to massively parallel
	systems, and is available from the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP)
	by anonymous FTP. Our program uses a maximum likelihood approach
	and is based on version 3.3 of Felsenstein's dnaml program. Several
	enhancements, including algorithmic changes, significantly improve
	performance and reduce memory usage, making it feasible to construct
	even very large trees. Trees containing 40-100 taxa have been easily
	generated, and phylogenetic estimates are possible even when hundreds
	of sequences exist. We are currently using the tool to construct
	a phylogenetic tree based on 473 small subunit rRNA sequences from
	prokaryotes.},

  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2005},
  volume = {6},
  pages = {278},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sequence alignment is a common tool in bioinformatics
	and comparative genomics. It is generally assumed that multiple sequence
	alignment yields better results than pair wise sequence alignment,
	but this assumption has rarely been tested, and never with the control
	provided by simulation analysis. This study used sequence simulation
	to examine the gain in accuracy of adding a third sequence to a pair
	wise alignment, particularly concentrating on how the phylogenetic
	position of the additional sequence relative to the first pair changes
	the accuracy of the initial pair's alignment as well as their estimated
	evolutionary distance. RESULTS: The maximal gain in alignment accuracy
	was found not when the third sequence is directly intermediate between
	the initial two sequences, but rather when it perfectly subdivides
	the branch leading from the root of the tree to one of the original
	sequences (making it half as close to one sequence as the other).
	Evolutionary distance estimation in the multiple alignment framework,
	however, is largely unrelated to alignment accuracy and rather is
	dependent on the position of the third sequence; the closer the branch
	leading to the third sequence is to the root of the tree, the larger
	the estimated distance between the first two sequences. CONCLUSION:
	The bias in distance estimation appears to be a direct result of
	the standard greedy progressive algorithm used by many multiple alignment
	methods. These results have implications for choosing new taxa and
	genomes to sequence when resources are limited.},

  volume = {6},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evolutionary distances are a critical measure in comparative
	genomics and molecular evolutionary biology. A simulation study was
	used to examine the effect of alignment accuracy of DNA sequences
	on evolutionary distance estimation. RESULTS: Under the studied conditions,
	distance estimation was relatively unaffected by alignment error
	(50% or more of the sites incorrectly aligned) as long as 50% or
	more of the sites were identical among the sequences (observed P-distance
	< 0.5). Beyond this threshold, the alignment procedure artificially
	inflates the apparent sequence identity, skewing distance estimates,
	and creating alignments that are essentially indistinguishable from
	random data. This general result was independent of substitution
	model, sequence length, and insertion and deletion size and rate.
	CONCLUSION: Examination of the estimated sequence identity may yield
	some guidance as to the accuracy of the alignment. Inaccurate alignments
	are expected to have large effects on analyses dependent on site
	specificity, but analyses that depend on evolutionary distance may
	be somewhat robust to alignment error as long as fewer than half
	of the sites have diverged.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:Most studies inferring species phylogenies use sequences
	from single copy genes or sets of orthologs culled from gene families.
	For taxa such as plants, with very high levels of gene duplication
	in their nuclear genomes, this has limited the exploitation of nuclear
	sequences for phylogenetic studies, such as those available in large
	EST libraries. One rarely used method of inference, gene tree parsimony,
	can infer species trees from gene families undergoing duplication
	and loss, but its performance has not been evaluated at a phylogenomic
	scale for EST data in plants.RESULTS:A gene tree parsimony analysis
	based on EST data was undertaken for six angiosperm model species
	and Pinus, an outgroup. Although a large fraction of the tentative
	consensus sequences obtained from the TIGR database of ESTs was assembled
	into homologous clusters too small to be phylogenetically informative,
	some 557 clusters contained promising levels of information. Based
	on maximum likelihood estimates of the gene trees obtained from these
	clusters, gene tree parsimony correctly inferred the accepted species
	tree with strong statistical support. A slight variant of this species
	tree was obtained when maximum parsimony was used to infer the individual
	gene trees instead.CONCLUSION:Despite the complexity of the EST data
	and the relatively small fraction eventually used in inferring a
	species tree, the gene tree parsimony method performed well in the
	face of very high apparent rates of duplication.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: The computation of large phylogenetic trees with statistical
	models such as maximum likelihood or bayesian inference is computationally
	extremely intensive. It has repeatedly been demonstrated that these
	models are able to recover the true tree or a tree which is topologically
	closer to the true tree more frequently than less elaborate methods
	such as parsimony or neighbor joining. Due to the combinatorial and
	computational complexity the size of trees which can be computed
	on a Biologist's PC workstation within reasonable time is limited
	to trees containing approximately 100 taxa. RESULTS: In this paper
	we present the latest release of our program RAxML-III for rapid
	maximum likelihood-based inference of large evolutionary trees which
	allows for computation of 1.000-taxon trees in less than 24 hours
	on a single PC processor. We compare RAxML-III to the currently fastest
	implementations for maximum likelihood and bayesian inference: PHYML
	and MrBayes. Whereas RAxML-III performs worse than PHYML and MrBayes
	on synthetic data it clearly outperforms both programs on all real
	data alignments used in terms of speed and final likelihood values.
	Availability SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: RAxML-III including all alignments
	and final trees mentioned in this paper is freely available as open

	obtained by DNA sequencing or restriction enzyme technique, a mathematical
	theory on the expected evolutionary relationship among DNA sequences
	(nucleons) sampled is developed under the assumption that the evolutionary
	change of nucleons is determined solely by mutation and random genetic
	drift. The statistical property of the number of nucleotide differences
	between randomly chosen nucleons and that of heterozygosity or nucleon
	diversity is investigated using this theory. These studies indicate
	that the estimates of the average number of nucleotide differences
	and nucleon diversity have a large variance, and a large part of
	this variance is due to stochastic factors. Therefore, increasing
	sample size does not help reduce the variance significantly. The
	distribution of sample allele (nucleomorph) frequencies is also studied,
	and it is shown that a small number of samples are sufficient in
	order to know the distribution pattern.}},

	and Ungaliophis) have been placed by many systematists in a single
	group (traditionally called Tropidophiidae). However, the monophyly
	of this group has been questioned in several studies. Moreover, the
	overall relationships among basal snake lineages, including the placement
	of the dwarf boas, are poorly understood. We obtained mtDNA sequence
	data for 12S, 16S, and intervening tRNA-val genes from 23 species
	of snakes representing most major snake lineages, including all four
	genera of New World dwarf boas. We then examined the phylogenetic
	position of these species by estimating the phylogeny of the basal
	snakes. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that New World dwarf boas
	are not monophyletic. Instead, we find Exiliboa and Ungaliophis to
	be most closely related to sand boas (Erycinae), boas (Boinae), and
	advanced snakes (Caenophidea), whereas Tropidophis and Trachyboa
	form an independent clade that separated relatively early in snake
	radiation. Our estimate of snake phylogeny differs significantly
	in other ways from some previous estimates of snake phylogeny. For
	instance, pythons do not cluster with boas and sand boas, but instead
	show a strong relationship with Loxocemus and Xenopeltis. Additionally,
	uropeltids cluster strongly with Cylindrophis, and together are embedded
	in what has previously been considered the macrostomatan radiation.
	These relationships are supported by both bootstrapping (parametric
	and nonparametric approaches) and Bayesian analysis, although Bayesian
	support values are consistently higher than those obtained from nonparametric
	bootstrapping. Simulations show that Bayesian support values represent
	much better estimates of phylogenetic accuracy than do nonparametric
	bootstrap support values, at least under the conditions of our study.},

  abstract = {Several authors have argued recently that extensive taxon sampling
	has a positive and important effect on the accuracy of phylogenetic
	estimates. However, other authors have argued that there is little
	benefit of extensive taxon sampling, and so phylogenetic problems
	can or should be reduced to a few exemplar taxa as a means of reducing
	the computational complexity of the phylogenetic analysis. In this
	paper we examined five aspects of study design that may have led
	to these different perspectives. First, we considered the measurement
	of phylogenetic error across a wide range of taxon sample sizes,
	and conclude that the expected error based on randomly selecting
	trees (which varies by taxon sample size) must be considered in evaluating
	error in studies of the effects of taxon sampling. Second, we addressed
	the scope of the phylogenetic problems defined by different samples
	of taxa, and argue that phylogenetic scope needs to be considered
	in evaluating the importance of taxon-sampling strategies. Third,
	we examined the claim that fast and simple tree searches are as effective
	as more thorough searches at finding near-optimal trees that minimize
	error. We show that a more complete search of tree space reduces
	phylogenetic error, especially as the taxon sample size increases.
	Fourth, we examined the effects of simple versus complex simulation
	models on taxonomic sampling studies. Although benefits of taxon
	sampling are apparent for all models, data generated under more complex
	models of evolution produce higher overall levels of error and show
	greater positive effects of increased taxon sampling. Fifth, we asked
	if different phylogenetic optimality criteria show different effects
	of taxon sampling. Although we found strong differences in effectiveness
	of different optimality criteria as a function of taxon sample size,
	increased taxon sampling improved the results from all the common
	optimality criteria. Nonetheless, the method that showed the lowest
	overall performance (minimum evolution) also showed the least improvement
	from increased taxon sampling. Taking each of these results into
	account re-enforces the conclusion that increased sampling of taxa
	is one of the most important ways to increase overall phylogenetic
	accuracy.},

  abstract = {Bayesian phylogenetic methods require the selection of prior probability
	distributions for all parameters of the model of evolution. These
	distributions allow one to incorporate prior information into a Bayesian
	analysis, but even in the absence of meaningful prior information,
	a prior distribution must be chosen. In such situations, researchers
	typically seek to choose a prior that will have little effect on
	the posterior estimates produced by an analysis, allowing the data
	to dominate. Sometimes a prior that is uniform (assigning equal prior
	probability density to all points within some range) is chosen for
	this purpose. In reality, the appropriate prior depends on the parameterization
	chosen for the model of evolution, a choice that is largely arbitrary.
	There is an extensive Bayesian literature on appropriate prior choice,
	and it has long been appreciated that there are parameterizations
	for which uniform priors can have a strong influence on posterior
	estimates. We here discuss the relationship between model parameterization
	and prior specification, using the general time-reversible model
	of nucleotide evolution as an example. We present Bayesian analyses
	of 10 simulated data sets obtained using a variety of prior distributions
	and parameterizations of the general time-reversible model. Uniform
	priors can produce biased parameter estimates under realistic conditions,
	and a variety of alternative priors avoid this bias.},
