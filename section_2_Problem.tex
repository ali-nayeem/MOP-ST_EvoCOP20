\section{Problem Description}
\label{sec:problem}
We are given a set of $M$ rooted binary trees as a collection gene trees each having $N$-taxon. We need to construct the species tree, a rooted binary tree with $N$-taxon, from these gene trees by simultaneously optimizing the following three objective functions:  
\begin{enumerate}[label=$F\arabic*$.]
		
	\item Maximize QT 
	 \subitem {\footnotesize QT: number of consistent quartets (i.e., unrooted 4-taxon tree) between the species tree and the gene trees (used by ASTRAL\cite{mirarab2014astral})}
	\item Maximize TP
		\subitem {\footnotesize TP: number of consistent triplets (i.e., rooted 3-taxon tree) between the species tree and the gene trees (used by STELAR~\cite{islam2019stelar})}
	\item Maximize PL 
		\subitem {\footnotesize PL: pseudo-likelihood estimate of the species tree utilizing the underlying triplet distribution of the gene trees (used by MP-EST~\cite{mpest})}
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{In subsequent sections, we treat each objective into minimization by multiplying with -1}. Unlike traditional multi-objective optimization
problems (MOPs), here our goal is not to properly approximate the Pareto front (PF). 
%The traditional definition of convergence is may not be applicable in this problem. 
Moreover, here a dominated solution can be better in terms of tree accuracy than a non-dominated. Therefore in this paper, we try to design a special-purpose EMO algorithm which is able find a tree-space containing highly accurate species trees. 
%Each of the above functions (optimized by an existing method) has some ability to predict the species tree accuracy but none of them can necessarily lead towards the most accurate species tree. Therefore, optimizing them together, by an EMO algorithm, will generate a set of candidate solutions which is expected to contain a species tree which is more accurate than the output of the existing methods.
